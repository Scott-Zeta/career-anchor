# Career Anchor Assessment Platform

## Overview

The Career Anchor Assessment Platform is a modern web application designed to help individuals discover and understand their core career values and motivations. Based on Edgar Schein's Career Anchors framework from MIT, this tool provides valuable insights into what truly drives your career decisions.

This project was developed as part of StudyAdelaide's Leadership Empowerment Program, a prestigious initiative aimed at fostering leadership development among international students in Adelaide. The application has been successfully integrated into the program's workshops, helping students better understand their career motivations and make informed decisions about their professional paths.

## What Are Career Anchors?

Career anchors are the fundamental values, motivations, and needs that guide your career choices. They represent:

- What you're naturally good at (your skills and competencies)
- What drives you (your motives and needs)
- What matters most to you (your values)

## Key Features

- **Interactive Assessment**: A comprehensive questionnaire to identify your dominant career anchors
- **Visual Results**: Clear visualization of your career anchor profile through radar charts and progress indicators
- **Detailed Insights**: In-depth descriptions of each career anchor and what they mean for your career path
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, intuitive design that makes complex career concepts accessible
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Fully responsive design that works seamlessly on all devices

## The Eight Career Anchors

1. **Technical/Functional Competence**

   - For those who thrive on being experts in their field

2. **General Management**

   - For those who enjoy leading and coordinating diverse functions

3. **Autonomy/Independence**
