## What Are Career Anchors?

Career anchors are the fundamental values, motivations, and needs that guide your career choices. They represent:

- What you're naturally good at (your skills and competencies)
- What drives you (your motives and needs)
- What matters most to you (your values)

## Key Features

- **Interactive Assessment**: A comprehensive questionnaire to identify your dominant career anchors
- **Visual Results**: Clear visualization of your career anchor profile through radar charts and progress indicators
- **Detailed Insights**: In-depth descriptions of each career anchor and what they mean for your career path
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, intuitive design that makes complex career concepts accessible
