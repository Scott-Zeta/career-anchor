                  People who have this anchor, have an overriding need to create

                  new venture, product or service of some sort is essential to

                  Some people will pursue a career because they want to embody

                  Initially it appears that the notion that one's career anchor
                  is organized around lifestyle is a contradiction in terms.
                  However, many people who are highly motivated towards a
                  meaningful career, find themselves in situations that mean
                  their careers must be integrated into their total lifestyle.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                  This is an evolving process, ergo people who find themselves
                  in this situation want flexibility above all else. When
                  seeking employment they are more likely to be interested in an
                  organisation's attitude towards personal/family concerns, than
                  the sector or area of expertise. They may even take long
                  periods off work in which to indulge in their passions.

          Understanding your career anchors can help you make more informed

          Consider discussing your results with a career counselor or mentor who
